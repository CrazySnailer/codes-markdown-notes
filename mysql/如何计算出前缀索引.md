###第一种方法

####统计字段的重复性
```
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, city FROM city_demo GROUP BY city ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 10;
```
####接下来需要查找到最常见的前缀
```
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, LEFT(city, 3) AS pref FROM city_demo GROUP BY pref ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 10;
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, LEFT(city, 4) AS pref FROM city_demo GROUP BY pref ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 10;
mysql> SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, LEFT(city, 5) AS pref FROM city_demo GROUP BY pref ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 10;
```
如此直到找到合适的前缀个数。

###第二种方法

####计算全列的选择性
```
mysql> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city)/COUNT(*) FROM city_demo;
```
####查询不同前缀长度的选择率
```
mysql> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(city, 3))/COUNT(*) AS sel3,
		-> COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(city, 4))/COUNT(*) AS sel4,
		-> COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(city, 5))/COUNT(*) AS sel5,
		-> COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(city, 6))/COUNT(*) AS sel6,
		-> COUNT(DISTINCT LEFT(city, 7))/COUNT(*) AS sel7
		-> FROM city_demo;
根据长度，观察选择率提升的幅度。  
根据经验选择率接近0.3会比较好，但是不绝对，需要考虑最坏情况的选择率加以调整，使其平衡。
前缀索引能够很好的减少索引的大小及提高速度，坏处是不能在ORDER BY或者GROUP BY查询中使用前缀索引，也不能呢用作覆盖索引。
